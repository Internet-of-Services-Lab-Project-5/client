# Client

This is the repository for the React frontend app. It can communicate with the server form the server repository/

## Installation

```
npm i
```

### Starting the app locally

This will run on `localhost:5173`

```
npm start
```

### Environment

You will need to place a `.env` file in the root directory. In that file, you need only the variable `VITE_SERVER_URL`.
If your server is running on localhost then it should probably look like this:

```
VITE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000
```
